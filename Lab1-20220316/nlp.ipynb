POS tags are especially useful when a word can have different functions in a sentence with the exact same form, so we cannot just take a look at the word itself and draw conclusions. For example, \"type\" can mean a category or a verb (to type). For these reasons, we have POS taggers. A POS tagger classifies each unit's syntactic function in the sentence. There are different types of POS taggers. The one we will use is actually a pre-trained machine learning classifier of NLTK.

However, note that tweets have many other elements to consider as well:\n","\n","* Hashtags\n","* User handles (usernames)\n","* URLs\n","* Numbers\n","* Stop words (like \"the\" and \"is\")\n","* Emojis\n","* Punctuations\n","* Typographic errors\n","\n","In certain cases, we cannot learn much from them, so removing them would reduce the noise. In some cases, they can provide valuable information. For example, emojis can convey a message, so one might prefer to keep them. While some of the elements would wildly vary and make too much noise, indicators for their existence could be helpful as well. So, we could conflate them under a general type-specific token such as \"\\<number\\>.\" Keeping specific user handles could come handy for social network analysis, but our focus here is text analysis. The existence of a question or exclamation mark can be informative as well, but we will not specifically analyze them. These removals and such are done after lemmatization to preserve the sentence structure that is helpful for POS tagging.\n","\n","We can automatically correct typographic errors to reduce the noise even further. An easy way one can do it is by using a dictionary and finding the closest word for words that do not exist in the dictionary. We can use \"autocorrect\" package for this. Note that since the dictionary may not be that extensive while tweets can be quite colloquial and noisy, it would probably be actually harmful. Therefore, we will not use it, but you can pass `autocorrect=True` below and see how it affects your results. This process makes use of [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), which we will talk about later.\n","\n","We can write a function to streamline these processes. The function below takes a tweet and applies all of the processes in order. It also has some parameters that affect how certain tokens are handled. By default:\n","\n","* Numbers are directly removed instead of being conflated under \"\\<number\\>\"\n","* Users are directly removed instead of being conflated under \"\\<user\\>\"\n","* Hashtags are directly removed instead of being conflated under \"\\<hashtag\\>\"\n","* URLs are directly removed instead of being conflated under \"\\<url\\>\"\n","* Emojis are removed\n","* Punctuations are removed\n","* Negations are marked\n","* Autocorrection is off\n","\n","We can change these behaviors on the go by specifying some parameters.\n","\n","While processing the tweets, we might as well extract n-grams. N-grams are n-many units that consecutively occur in a sentence. They can be more useful than simply looking at individual units. For example, individually looking at the words \"positive\" and \"test\" lose their collective meaning compared to \"positive test.\" It is rather obvious when we look at the unigrams (individual units) of a single sentence, but it may not be as clear when we aggregate all of the data. N-grams help us retain more information. When these consecutive unit groups are duples, they are called bigrams (2-grams). Consider the following text: \n","\n","`This is a sentence. This one too.`\n","\n","The bigrams would be as follows:\n","\n","* <span style=\"background-color:#9e0059; color:white\">This</span> - <span style=\"background-color:#118ab2; color:white\">is</span>\n","* <span style=\"background-color:#118ab2; color:white\">is</span> - <span style=\"background-color:#553739; color:white\">a</span>\n","* <span style=\"background-color:#553739; color:white\">a</span> - <span style=\"background-color:#8338ec; color:white\">sentence</span>\n","* <span style=\"background-color:#cf995f; color:white\">This</span> - <span style=\"background-color:#43aa8b; color:white\">one</span>\n","* <span style=\"background-color:#43aa8b; color:white\">one</span> - <span style=\"background-color:#577590; color:white\">too</span>\n","\n","Punctuations are mostly not included in n-grams. Also note that \"sentence\" and the second \"this\" do not constitute a bigram as we look for consecutive units within the same sentence. \n","\n","We can actually use NLTK to extract bigrams in this manner, but it may not be as straightforward as shown above if we are not interested in all the units. For example, we would prefer to not include the stop words since they would not give much information anyway, and our bigrams would be bloated. We also want them to be normalized to decrease the noise, so we need to process the units first. At the same time, we do not want to pair two units that are not consecutive in the original sentence. Therefore, our function needs to extract the bigrams as it processes the tokens. One alternative would be storing unit index with the filtered lemmas which can be later used for n-gram extraction."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"dJVacxB5x0aL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647377231380,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":291,"user":{"displayName":"arif ozan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjrYbbjhxiHU_Rc0pVMA2rbfoax0H85Mss6El4sQg=s64","userId":"12465436653524186566"}}},"source":["from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","import sys\n","import re\n","import nltk.data\n","from nltk import pos_tag_sents\n","# If you have Anaconda, you can install emoji using \n","# \"conda install -c conda-forge emoji\" command.

There is still room for some improvements. For example, we could use [chunking](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html#chunking) in order to combine linked tokens that constitute a single entity. For example, \"the,\" \"United,\" and \"States\" tokens could be combined as \"the United States.\" You may have noticed that the United States is commonly reffered as \"the U.S.\" and it causes residual-like tokens. We could create a dictionary to map these common abbreviations to their normal forms before tokenization (or add it to the expansions of contractions using `contractions.add(\"U.S.\" \"United States\")` so that it is corrected with the other contractions. Lastly, while our tokenizer shortens consecutively repeating characters to at most three consecutive repetitions (\"heyyyyyy!!!!!!!\" becomes \"heyyy!!!\") due to having `reduce_len=True`, it cannot handle \"😂😂😂😂😂\" since they are separated into individual tokens. These token-level repetitions could be handled and consecutively repeated emojis could be even cleaned as well since they can affect n-gram distributions.\n","\n","Anyway, we can now look at the term frequencies.

Sentiment analysis<a id=\"sentiment\"></a>\n","\n","We can automatically detect the sentiment of words (and therefore sentences) without the need of manually reading labeling all the data. This can be especially useful for contents that target specific products or people, but we can apply this to our dataset as well. Sentiment analysis can be done using  We will simply use NLTK's sentiment analyzer that uses [VADER tool and lexicon](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/VADER%3A-A-Parsimonious-Rule-Based-Model-for-Analysis-Hutto-Gilbert/bcdc102c04fb0e7d4652e8bcc7edd2983bb9576d). Lexicons are collections of words designed for specific purposes and making sense of textual data in general. They can be about sentiments, emotions, or other purpose-specific words (plants, animals, etc.). We could collect positive words (such as \"nice\" and \"wonderful\") in a file, and check if a sentence has words from that file, indicating whether they are associated with positive sentiments. This would be our positive words lexicon. Alternatively, we could collect words that have a sentiment value (valence), and assign sentiment scores for them. So, we could assign \"great\" to \"1\" (positive) and \"terrible\" to \"-1\" (negative). VADER actually works like this. It is a word list that is manually rated by different individuals to obtain mean sentiment scores for each word. Naturally, there are other things to consider as well. For example, apart from negation, the existence of certain words also modify the sentiment's intensity (\"bad\" becomes even more negative with the word \"very\"). VADER handles these (and more) for us, so we can simply tokenize sentences and feed them to the analyzer to retrieve the normalized (between -1 and 1) sentence-level sentiment scores:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"22pi6GZVx0aN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647377915034,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":277,"user":{"displayName":"arif ozan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjrYbbjhxiHU_Rc0pVMA2rbfoax0H85Mss6El4sQg=s64","userId":"12465436653524186566"}},"outputId":"9ce99402-8d32-4e7d-f26a-dd3de58f0598"},"source":["from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n","\n","sentiment_analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n","\n","# Notice how sentiment scores differ for the following sentences:\n","sentences = [\"It looks VERY BAD!!!\", \n","             \"It looks VERY BAD.\", \n","             \"It looks very bad.\", \n","             \"It looks bad.\", \n","             \"It does not look very bad.\", \n","             \"It does not look bad.\", \n","             \"It looks good.\", \n","             \"It looks good!\", \n","             \"It looks VERY BAD!!!

You are encouraged to explore these tweets and other methods for analysis.\n","\n","Note that there are some important limitations. A word can have different meanings in different domains/contexts. Consider these sentences:\n","\n","* This song is **sick**. → Nice.👍\n","* This child is **sick**. → Not nice.👎\n","\n","Sometimes, a word can have one meaning yet different implications.

[Check](https://towardsdatascience.com/basic-binary-sentiment-analysis-using-nltk-c94ba17ae386) this example.\n","\n","If you are interested in lexicon-based approaches, take a look at [EmoLex](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm), a lexicon for emotions and sentiment. It can be used to automatize emotion detection. It also has Turkish words (along with some other languages), but they are an automatic translation, so they are not as reliable. You can now directly download it from its web page.\n","\n","## Bonus: Levenshtein distance<a id=\"levenshtein\"></a>\n","\n","As mentioned above, a simple autocorrection process can be applied using the Levenshtein distance. Let us see what that means. \n","\n","Consider the words `cup` and `cap`. Their Levenshtein distance is 1, because we can obtain one from the other by simply substituting a character. For two given strings, we can calculate the number of operations required (edit distance) to obtain one from the another. These operations are:\n","\n","* Insertion: Inserting a character to a specific location in the string.\n","    * \"up\" becomes \"**c**up\"\n","* Deletion: Deleting a character from a specific location in the string.\n","    * \"cu**s**p\" becomes \"cup\"\n","* Substitution: Substituting a character in a specific location in the string with another character.\n","    * \"c**u**p\" becomes \"c**a**p\"\n","* Transpotisition (this is later introduced by an extension, the Damerau-Levenstein distance algorithm): Switching the positions of two adjacent characters.\n","    * \"c**pu**\" becomes \"c**up**\"\n","    \n","Using these, for a given word, we can find the closest word from a dictionary that would require the least amount of changes. This is a costly process, so it is usually limited to certain amount of changes. See [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) for more information.\n","\n","We can also use this distance to calculate the similarity between two strings. This is handy for fuzzy string matching, when the same thing can be represented in similar yet different forms. This is quite common in neighborhood or street names in Turkey. By setting a similarity threshold and looking at their similarity, we can match addresses like `Kemalpaşa Mah.` and `Kemal Paşa Mahallesi`."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"E6MNE83Px0aO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647378925615,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"arif ozan","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjrYbbjhxiHU_Rc0pVMA2rbfoax0H85Mss6El4sQg=s64","userId":"12465436653524186566"}},"outputId":"2e46e4b4-8d71-4729-a04d-95f4344331a9"},"source":["import Levenshtein\n","\n","string_a = \"Kemalpaşa Mah.\"\n","string_b = \"Kemal Paşa Mahallesi\"\n","\n","Levenshtein.ratio(string_a, string_b)\n","# Note that you would probably want to remove \"mahallesi\" or \"mah.\" when your task is \n","# address matching.
