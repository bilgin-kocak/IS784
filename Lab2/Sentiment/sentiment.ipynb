So, each word's occurrence (given that they are chosen to form our vector) was simply represented by one component of the vector. Here, each component is actually a dimension rather than a mere occurrence count of a given word in that document. This is called \"distributed representation.\" Think about the furnitures and items in your room. They all have an X, Y, and Z coordinates with respect to the center point of your room. Therefore, we can represent these furnitures using `<X, Y, Z>` vectors. The lamp is right at the center of your ceiling. The carpet is at the floor. The wall clock is on the wall in front of you, vertically between the lamp and the carpet. X, Y, or Z do not represent the existence of a specific furniture. These furnitures exist at those specific points in the space (your room). So, it is possible to represent words or documents in high-dimensional spaces.\n","\n","1. **Can we even represent many words (documents) with smaller vector sizes?**\n","\n","Think about the amount of furnitures you can represent using their relative X, Y, and Z coordinates in your room. It is way more than the number of dimenions in this scenario. Likewise, we can now efficiently squeeze in many representations in fewer dimensions. Still, this example vectorization was overly simplified for demonstration purposes. Normally, higher dimensions (something between 100–⁠300) are preferred. Compared to the simple bag of words approach, it is slightly harder to comprehend and envision higher dimensions. Luckily, computers do not care as much.\n","\n","1. **Why do not these two documents have the same representation?**\n","\n","Remember that we are now using Doc2Vec and we embed documents. So, instead of representing furnitures in your room, we are actually representing the room itself. When we change the position of a certain furniture (word) in the room (document), the representation changes. In some cases, you might prefer to use Word2Vec, obtain word-level vectors, and average them together to obtain document-level representations.\n","\n","Let us vectorize the dataset using
